                    <li>
                        In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and 1 cup of granulated sugar.

                    <li>
                        Stir over medium heat until the sugar completely dissolves, creating a simple syrup.

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Pour the prepared sugar syrup over the fruits slices, ensuring they are fully submerged.

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Let the fruits slices soak in the syrup for about 30 minutes to allow them to absorb the sweetness.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        After soaking, drain the fruits slices, removing excess syrup.

                    <li>
                        Allow them to dry for 2 to 3 days, turning the slices occasionally for even drying.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Bring the fruits indoors during the night to prevent moisture absorption.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        If you have a food dehydrator, place the fruits slices on the trays.

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Follow the dehydrator's instructions for drying fruit, typically around 135¬∞F (57¬∞C) for 8-12 hours.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        The dried fruits should be leathery but slightly pliable. They should not be sticky.

                    <li>
                        4 cups grated mature coconut                        </li>
                    <li>
                        2 cups brown sugar
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 cup water
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
                    </li>

                <br>
                
            
                    <h3>Instructions</h3>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                
                    <li>
                        Use mature coconut for a richer flavor. Peel the brown skin off the coconut and grate it finely.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        In a large pan, combine the grated coconut and water. <br>
                        Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning. <br>
                        Continue cooking until the coconut becomes slightly toasted and aromatic. <br>
                        This step usually takes around 10-15 minutes.

                    </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Add the brown sugar to the toasted coconut. <br>
                        Stir continuously to ensure that the sugar is well distributed and melted evenly.
                    </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Continue cooking the mixture over medium heat until it thickens and becomes sticky. This process usually takes another 10-15 minutes.

                    </li>
                       
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            To check if the bukayo is ready, take a small amount of the mixture and drop it onto a plate. If it holds its shape and doesn't spread too much, it's done.

                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            If desired, add vanilla extract to enhance the flavor of the bukayo. Stir well to incorporate.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, remove it from heat.

                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Allow it to cool slightly, so it's easier to handle.

                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            While still warm, shape the bukayo into bite-sized pieces or your preferred shapes.
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Allow the bukayo to cool completely before serving or storing. This will help it firm up.

                        <br>
                        - Place the fried banana chips on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Allow them to cool for a few minutes.

                        <br>
