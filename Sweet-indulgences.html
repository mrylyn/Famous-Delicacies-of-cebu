                    <br>

                
                    <li>
                        Peel and thinly slice them into uniform pieces.

                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and 1 cup of granulated sugar.

                    </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Stir over medium heat until the sugar completely dissolves, creating a simple syrup.

                    </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Place the sliced fruits in a bowl.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Pour the prepared sugar syrup over the fruits slices, ensuring they are fully submerged.
                       
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Let the fruits slices soak in the syrup for about 30 minutes to allow them to absorb the sweetness.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        After soaking, drain the fruits slices, removing excess syrup.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Arrange the fruits slices on a wire rack or a lined baking sheet, ensuring they are spaced apart.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Place the arranged fruits slices in direct sunlight.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Allow them to dry for 2 to 3 days, turning the slices occasionally for even drying.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Bring the fruits indoors during the night to prevent moisture absorption.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        If you have a food dehydrator, place the fruits slices on the trays.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Follow the dehydrator's instructions for drying fruit, typically around 135°F (57°C) for 8-12 hours.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        The dried fruits should be leathery but slightly pliable. They should not be sticky.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Allow the dried fruits slices to cool completely.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Store them in an airtight container or sealable bags to maintain freshness.

                        Add the brown sugar to the toasted coconut. <br>
                        Stir continuously to ensure that the sugar is well distributed and melted evenly.

                    <li>
                        Continue cooking the mixture over medium heat until it thickens and becomes sticky. This process usually takes another 10-15 minutes.

                            To check if the bukayo is ready, take a small amount of the mixture and drop it onto a plate. If it holds its shape and doesn't spread too much, it's done.

                        <br>

                            If desired, add vanilla extract to enhance the flavor of the bukayo. Stir well to incorporate.

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, remove it from heat.

                        <li>
                            Allow it to cool slightly, so it's easier to handle.

                            While still warm, shape the bukayo into bite-sized pieces or your preferred shapes.

                            Allow the bukayo to cool completely before serving or storing. This will help it firm up.
