                    <br>

                
                    <li>
                        Peel and thinly slice them into uniform pieces.

                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and 1 cup of granulated sugar.

                    </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Stir over medium heat until the sugar completely dissolves, creating a simple syrup.

                    </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Place the sliced fruits in a bowl.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Pour the prepared sugar syrup over the fruits slices, ensuring they are fully submerged.
                       
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Let the fruits slices soak in the syrup for about 30 minutes to allow them to absorb the sweetness.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        After soaking, drain the fruits slices, removing excess syrup.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Arrange the fruits slices on a wire rack or a lined baking sheet, ensuring they are spaced apart.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Place the arranged fruits slices in direct sunlight.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Allow them to dry for 2 to 3 days, turning the slices occasionally for even drying.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Bring the fruits indoors during the night to prevent moisture absorption.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        If you have a food dehydrator, place the fruits slices on the trays.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Follow the dehydrator's instructions for drying fruit, typically around 135째F (57째C) for 8-12 hours.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        The dried fruits should be leathery but slightly pliable. They should not be sticky.

                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Allow the dried fruits slices to cool completely.

                        Add the brown sugar to the toasted coconut. <br>
                        Stir continuously to ensure that the sugar is well distributed and melted evenly.

                        Continue cooking the mixture over medium heat until it thickens and becomes sticky. This process usually takes another 10-15 minutes.

                            To check if the bukayo is ready, take a small amount of the mixture and drop it onto a plate. If it holds its shape and doesn't spread too much, it's done.

                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, remove it from heat.

                            Allow it to cool slightly, so it's easier to handle.

                            Allow the bukayo to cool completely before serving or storing. This will help it firm up.
