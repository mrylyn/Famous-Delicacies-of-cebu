                                        <li>1. Rinse the glutinous rice under cold water until the water runs clear.<br>
                                            Soak the rice in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                                        <li>2. Drain the soaked rice and place it in a steamer lined with cheesecloth or muslin cloth.<br>
                                            Steam the rice over medium-high heat for about 30-40 minutes or

                                        <li>5. Once the rice is cooked, 
                                            transfer it to a large mixing bowl.</li>
                                        <li>6. Pour the sugar syrup over the rice and gently fold to coat the rice evenly. 
                                            Let it cool for a few minutes.</li>

                                            round discs or rectangles. 
                                            You can use a mold for a more uniform shape.</li>
                                        <li>9.If desired, sprinkle sesame seeds on top 
                                            of each ampao for added flavor and texture.</li>
                                        <li>10. Place the shaped ampao on
                                            a flat surface or tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
                                        <li>11. Allow the rice crisps to air-dry for at least 
                                            4-6 hours or until they are firm and no longer sticky.</li>
                                        <li>12. Once completely dry, store the ampao in an airtight

                                    <li>Drain the boiled pork slices and let them air-dry or pat them dry with paper towels.
                                        <br> Ensure they are completely dry before frying to avoid oil splatters.</li>

                    <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 cup water</li>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <br>
                <br>

                <li>Use mature coconut for a richer flavor.
                    <br> Peel the brown skin off the coconut and grate it finely.</li> 
                <li>In a large pan, combine the grated coconut and water.</li>
                <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
                    <br>Continue cooking until the coconut becomes slightly toasted and aromatic. 
                    <br>This step usually takes around 10-15 minutes.<br>
                    Stir continuously to ensure that the sugar is well distributed and melted evenly.<br>   </li>
                <li>Add the brown sugar to the toasted coconut.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking the mixture over medium heat until it thickens and becomes sticky. 
                    <br>This process usually takes another 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>To check if the bukayo is ready, take a small amount of the mixture and drop it onto a plate.
                     <br>If it holds its shape and doesn't spread too much, it's done.</li>
                <li> If desired, add vanilla extract to enhance the flavor of the bukayo.
                    <br> Stir well to incorporate.</li>
                <li>Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, remove it from heat.</li>    
                <li>Allow it to cool slightly, so it's easier to handle.</li>    
                <li>9. While still warm, shape the bukayo into bite-sized pieces or your preferred shapes.</li>    
                <li>10. Allow the bukayo to cool completely before serving or storing. This will help it firm up.</li>

                                                     <br> will use them as a wrapping for the tamales. Set aside.</li>
                                                   <li>Place the cob standing up and with a sharp knife, cut down the side to remove the kernels. 
                                                    <br>Continue cutting while rotating the corn until all the kernels are removed. 
                                                    <br>You can place the ear of corn inside a large bowl to keep all the kernels from spilling all over while cutting it. </li>
                                                   <li> Using a food processor or blender, process the corn for 3-5 minutes or until smooth and creamy. 
                                                       <br>Transfer into a large bowl and combine the margarine, powdered milk, sugar and glutinous rice flour. Mix until well blended.</li>
                                                   <li>Use the husk and put a heaping tablespoon of corn mixture into the center.
                                                      <br> If the husk is too small, you may use 2-4 pcs and overlap them to each other. Fold husk lengthwise and bring two ends together.</li>
                                                   <li>Place them into a steamer basket and steam for 20 minutes over boiling water with medium heat. 
                                                       <br>Remove from the steamer and let it cool for 5 minutes. Serve and enjoy</li>

                     <li>In a bowl, marinate the pork slices with vinegar, crushed garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, and salt. 
                        <br>Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
                     <li>Transfer the marinated pork to a pot and add enough water to cover the meat. Bring it to a boil, then simmer until the pork is tender.
                        <br> This step helps in achieving a crispy texture when frying.</li>

                                         <li>In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and 1 cup of granulated sugar.</li>
                                         <li> Stir over medium heat until the sugar completely dissolves, creating a simple syrup.</li>

                                         <li> Let the mango slices soak in the syrup for about 30 minutes to allow them to absorb the sweetness.</li>
                                         <li> After soaking, drain the mango slices, removing excess syrup.</li>
                                         <li> Arrange the mango slices on a wire rack or a lined baking sheet, ensuring they are spaced apart.</li>

                                         <li>Bring the mangoes indoors during the night to prevent moisture absorption.</li>
                                         <li> If you have a food dehydrator, place the mango slices on the trays.</li>
                                         <li> Follow the dehydrator's instructions for drying fruit, typically around 135°F (57°C) for 8-12 hours.</li>
                                         <li> The dried mangoes should be leathery but slightly pliable. They should not be sticky.</li>
